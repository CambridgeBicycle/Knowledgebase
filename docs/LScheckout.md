### How to check out a customer

Navigate to the "Sales" tab on the left side of the screen. From there, click the " + New Sale" button, which will be the furthest icon to the right in the top row. Alternatively, you can type "Alt-N".

You will be prompted to enter your employee PIN. 

Once you've entered your PIN, the sale screen will appear. You can scan the item the customer wants to purchase or type it in manually in the item search bar near the top left of the screen. A number of common labor items (flat repair, chain replace, brake pad replace, etc.) can also be found by clicking the buttons to the right of the search bar. 

Adjust the quantity as needed manually by adjusting the quantity field of the item or by simply scanning the items barcode again.

Once all the items and/or labor items are displaying correctly, click the large green "Payment" button to the right of the screen. 

In the payment screen, you can select the correct payment type on the right side of the screen, like credit/debit, cash, or gift card.

In the case of credit/debit, make sure that you are using the proper payment terminal (Register 1 for the front desk and Register 2 for the service terminal). After you've verified that, click the "Start Payment" button. Click the large green "Finish Sale" button to the right once the payment has been captured. Print a receipt for the customer using the front receipt printer (Star TSP100).  

In the case of cash transactions, simply type in the total amount of cash provided by the customer. Lightspeed will automatically calculate the correct change to give to the customer. Click the large green "Finish Sale" button. You will need to print a paper receipt to the front receipt printer (Star TSP100) for the register to open. Put the cash in the drawer and deduct the correct amount of change. Provide the change and receipt to the customer and close the drawer. 

In the case of a gift card, scan the customer's gift card. Once you've done that, the remaining balance will appear. If the balance fully covers their purchase, simply click the large green "Finish Sale" button and print them a receipt using the front receipt printer (Star TSP100). If the balance does not fully cover the transaction, then the customer can pay the remainder with a credit/debit card or cash using the same steps above. 

Congratulations! You've learned how to check out a customer!
