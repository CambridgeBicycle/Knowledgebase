#Deposits
### When to take a deposit
We generally take full deposits for bikes that are sold but not picked up yet and special order bikes. We usually take half deposits for repair appointments that have special orders that we don't normally stock. (e.g. If a customer needs, say a basic 8 speed chain and we happen to be out of them, we wouldn't usually take a deposit for that). If the bike for that repair is being left at the shop until the repair is completed, you can generally treat that as collateral instead of taking a deposit, provided that the parts aren't worth more than the bike. This is something you absolutely want a second opinion on if you have any questions.


### How to take a deposit
You'll need to be in a sale window with the customer attached to the sale to take a deposit. You do NOT need to have any items added to the sale. Hit payment to go to the payment screen. The top row, marked 'Open Orders', will have the total cost of all the customer's special orders and workorders. Underneath that will be the 'Add Deposit button'. Hitting that will open a pop-up that will prompt you to enter an amount, and that amount will be added to the total payment collected today. Finish the sale as usual.

### How to checkout a customer with a deposit on file
With the customer account attached to the sale, proceed to the payment screen as you normally would. The 'Account' field will have an available total, which is the deposit(s) that they've placed with us.

Customers may have placed multiple deposits and we'd like to keep the proper deposit on file if for example they have placed 2 special orders and are only picking up one, so if the amounts don't match up look in their customer profile. Either type in the amount of the deposit you'd like to apply to this sale or hit the 'Max' button to apply the total deposit. If there's a remaining balance, you can take cash or a credit payment as usual now. Hit finish sale!
