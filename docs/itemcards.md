### Importing item cards from a Catalog
When you need to import an item from a vendor's catalog, you'll generally be doing it from the search field of a sale, work order, or purchase order. The easiest way to find the *exact* item you're looking for is to search for the item's UPC, a manufacturer's SKU, or a vendor's item code. You will need to click the 'Advanced' dropdown right next to the search button and make sure that the 'Catalog results' button is checked.

The search results will show up in two different tabs. The left tab will show you matching results already in our inventory (if any) and the right tab will be all matching results from all our vendor catalogs.

You want to make sure that you're selecting the right item, from the right vendor. The vendor you select should usually be the name of the vendor we order from. It gets confusing, as some companies have obsolete catalogs available through Lightspeed or the product is carried by many distributors. For example, searches for a Cane Creek headset product will return 10 results, all for the same product. 
Usually the correct answer for what catalog to pick is QBP, J&B, or the manufacturer's name.

Once you know which item to import, hit the 'Import' button on the far left of that row. It should open up the item card for the new item. Most of the fields should autofill, but you'll need to set the Category nearly every time. Verify that the cost (from our distributor) is accurate, as well as the 'Default Price' and the name (Make it readable and match as close as possible to other)
