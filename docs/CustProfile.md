#Customer Profiles

### Best practices:
At minimum, we want to collect the customer's first and last names (spelled correctly and capitalized) and their phone number. Enter the phone number in the 'Mobile' field, with spaces between sets of numbers and no other punctuation.

We want to check that we don't already have a profile for this customer before starting a new one. Lots of customers have multiple profiles that get created for them. Best practice is to search for their first name, and confirm that it's the same person by checking their phone number

### Create a customer profile 
Creating a customer profile can be started from a few places. You'll likely be adding a new customer from the Sale window or when creating a work order. You will need to attach a customer profile to any bike sale!

Work orders will prompt you to attach a customer when they are created. As you enter the customer's information, possible matches will appear on the right hand side. If no match is found, you can hit 'Create New Customer' after entering the first and last names and phone number.

From the Sale screen, you can search for a customer in the top left. If nothing turns up, you can create a profile by clicking the "+ New Customer" button at the top right of the screen. Creating a customer here looks a little different from the work order screen, but you just need to enter the customer's full name and phone number in the mobile section. Don't forget to hit Save Changes!
