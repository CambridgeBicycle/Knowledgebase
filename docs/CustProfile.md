#Customer Profiles

### Best practices:
At minimum, we want to collect the customer's first and last names (spelled correctly and capitalized) and their phone number. Enter the phone number in the 'Mobile' field, with spaces between sets of numbers and no other punctuation.

We want to check that we don't already have a profile for this customer before starting a new one. Lots of customers have multiple profiles that get created for them. Best practice is to search for their phone number after asking if they've gotten work done here before. If you find that cumbersome, I often just ask their name, and confirm that it's the same person by checking their phone number. 

### Create a customer profile 
Creating a customer profile can be started from a few places. You'll likely be adding a new customer from the Sale window or when creating a work order. You will need to attach a customer profile to any bike sale!

Work orders will prompt you to attach a customer when they are created. As you enter the customer's information, possible matches will appear on the right hand side. If no match is found, you can hit 'Create New Customer' after entering the first and last names and phone number.

From the Sale screen, you can search for a customer in the top left. If nothing turns up, you can create a profile by clicking the "+ New Customer" button at the top right of the screen. Creating a customer here looks a little different from the work order screen, but you just need to enter the customer's full name and phone number in the mobile section. Don't forget to hit Save Changes!

### Merging customer profiles

Occasionally, customers will end up with multiple accounts created for them. If you notice this, it's best to merge the accounts into a single one.

It's best to pick the account that has the most customer info already attached to it. Merging the accounts the accounts is irreversible, so we want to take our time and make sure that we're not making any mistakes. Any blank fields on the base account that have information saved to that field on the merged accounts will be updated. Any fields that are filled in on the base account and the merged account will retain the info of the base account.

Go to Customers in the main menu, hit Customers again, and find the customers' account. Click merge on the submenu. You'll need to search for the customer's other account(s). select the account(s) you want to merge, and click the merge button at the bottom.
