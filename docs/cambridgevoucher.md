It will display customer's name(don't forget to verify their ID at this point), voucher status (valid, redeemed or expired[if not valid and customer believes that it is in error, tell them to get in touch with city of Boston]), expiration date, type of eligible product(s) and the amount of the voucher.  

Hit redeem, create, and verify information is correct. The next page will have dropdown a menu to select the bike model.

The next page will have you enter the bike's serial number, the cost of the e-bike (Bike only, NOT including taxes, additional parts, labor, etc), the class of the e-bike, and have you answer some yes or no eligibility questions. Finally, you'll enter proof of sale - a pdf of the receipt is best. 
If you leave this process at any point, it should be automatically as a draft which can be resumed later from the 'My Voucher Redemptions' page.
