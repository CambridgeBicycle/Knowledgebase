### Maintenance voucher requirements.

* Voucher recipients will be provided the same or better after purchase service as our regular sales.
* Maintenance vouchers can only be used at the location where the bike was purchased.

* Unused portion cannot be transferred or not used



## Requirements for redemption
* Must confirm the name on each voucher matches the name of the buyer by checking the customers ID at the time of purchase  
	* Vouchers for minors will have a parent's name listed as well. In this case, you need to check the parent's ID (and only the parent's ID). Both should be present for the purchase.
* Vouchers must redeemed at the time of purchase (Not retroactive to previously purchased bikes).
* Maintenance vouchers good for 1 year after issue.
* Each voucher can only be used once (Can't be spread over multiple purchases).
* Vouchers can only be applied to the retail cost of the e-bike and sales tax. Bike Vouchers cannot be used for labor or accessories. 
* Excess voucher amounts cannot be transferred or used on something else.
* The serial number must be entered into the online portal at the time of sale
* An  itemized receipt noting the City of Cambridge E-Bike Incentive must be uploaded to the portal
* The City has a return policy process, but it explicitly does NOT supersede our own return policy. 
* Equipment vouchers are only good for eligible safety equipment.

***Proof of purchase requirements***

We are required to submit a receipt or invoice for each voucher redemption as proof of purchase

Each proof of purchase must include
* The make and model of the bike or the specific (no misc items) name of the eligible safety equipment product
* The extended price of bike or equipment before applying the voucher
* The value of the voucher clearly applied to the sale (There is a 'Voucher' payment type you should use for the eligible amount of the voucher)
* Eligible accessories and labor should be on different transactions than bike sales. 

## Redemption Process 
### Before you redeem a voucher:
* Have the following information on hand:
	* **For bike vouchers**: Bike Make and Model
	* **For bike vouchers**: Serial number
* Check voucher status
	* Go to [https://cityofcambridge.shinyapps.io/Bike_Lottery_Voucher_Redemption/](https://cityofcambridge.shinyapps.io/Bike_Lottery_Voucher_Redemption/)
	* Enter the 9 digit voucher number, do not include the letter.
	* The last letter of the voucher number indicates the voucher type: B for bicycle vouchers, A for accessories vouchers and M for maintenance vouchers.
	* Select the Voucher type and click the **Check Voucher Status** button.

It will display customer's name(don't forget to verify their ID at this point if you haven't already), voucher status (valid, redeemed or expired[if not valid and customer believes that it is in error, tell them to get in touch with The City of Cambridge]), expiration date, type of eligible product(s) and the amount of the voucher. 

If the voucher has been redeemed or cancelled or expired, you will not be able to redeem it. 

If the customer is using the voucher now, you can hit redeem now. If the customer will be using the voucher but we don't have all the necessary information to redeem it (likely situation would be the serial number of a special order bike), then we can put a hold on the voucher.

### Redeeming an E-Bike or Bike voucher

After hitting 'Redeem now', the next page will have you select our shop, enter your name, confirm that you've checked the customer's ID, enter the bike's make/model/serial number, and the total amount on the receipt. 

***The receipt should only have item(s) on it that are eligible for the voucher you are redeeming!*** Bikes/Accessories/Non-eligible items/labor should be on separate receipts!

You will need to upload a PDF of the receipt showing the full cost of the eligible item(s), voucher payment (this is a payment method in Lightspeed), and any additional customer payment if necessary. Cambridge vouchers **CAN** be used to pay for sales tax, unlike the other programs.

Press "Submit Invoice" when all fields are filled out.

### Placing an Available Voucher on hold 

If the customer is committing to buying a bike but we don't have the serial number available (e.g. we need to special order the bike), we will place a hold on the voucher so that it's not redeemed else where. After checking the voucher status, hit the 'Hold Voucher' button, select our shop and then hit 'Confirm Voucher hold'.

If the amount of the bike is over the voucher amount, you will still collect a deposit for the remaining amount.

### Releasing and redeeming an On Hold voucher.

**You may only release or redeem a voucher placed on hold by our store**

**ONLY a manager should be releasing a held voucher. You do not need to release a voucher our store placed on hold before redeeming it**

**Direct any customer requests to the store that originally placed the hold**

Hit 'Redeem voucher now' and you will go through the standard redemption process and be prompted to enter the serial number and upload the receipt.

Releasing a voucher makes it available for use at all other participating bike shops.

### Redeeming an accessories voucher

Very similar to the bike voucher redemption process. You will be prompted to summarize the accessories purchased as well as upload. The voucher may be applied to any accessories that "make cycling safer and more comfortable." This includes child seats or a car bike rack. The voucher may also be used for sales tax on those accessories. It MAY NOT be used for bikes, ebikes, or labor. Accessories that don't match the spirit of the "safe and comfortable" guideline are at our discretion, ask for guidance if you're not sure.

### Redeeming a maintenance voucher

 Very similar to the process of redeeming other vouchers, but there are a few requirements.
* Maintenance vouchers can only be redeemed after the associated bike voucher is redeemed. 
* Maintenance vouchers can only be redeemed at the store that the associated bike voucher was redeemed at.
* Maintenance vouchers can only be redeemed for maintenance costs of the bike purchased with the associated bike voucher. 
* This is not explicitly stated, but until the City of Cambridge clarifies, we should assume that the maintenance refers to strictly that and NOT optional upgrades (even really cool stuff like fender installs).
* Unused portion of the voucher cannot be transferred or used for other purposes. Vouchers can only be redeemed once.
