#Special Orders
### What to check before placing a special order
First we need to check that an item is in stock. Go to the vendors business-to-business(b2b) site (Don't use their retail consumer site to check inventory!) and make sure that it's available to order. If you're not sure what their B2B is, you can find it in the google doc called 'Distributor Masterlist', which should also be linked as a bookmark on all of our browsers.

In the off-season, it's good practice to make sure that we're able to place orders with vendors - check with one of the buyers to see if there are any issues with that particular vendor. 

J&B has very particular rules for their shipping policies - if an item is coming from a warehouse besides New York, check with a buyer before proceeding with the order.  

We take deposits for all special orders. The only exceptions are parts and accessories that we *always* try to keep in stock. We occasionally make exceptions for repair parts when the customer is leaving their bike with us, provided the cost of the parts is relatively small compared to the value of the bike. This scenario (and only this one) is a judgement call, ask for help if you're not 100% sure.  

**We take deposits on all special order bikes, no exceptions.** 

The deposit is at least 50% of the sell price. It's not an issue if they'd like to pay in full. We always enter the payment as a deposit in Lightspeed and finish out the sale when the item leaves the store.

### ETAs and timing

We place our orders on Monday mornings. Most of our shipments from east coast and midwestern warehouse will arrive by Thursday. Some vendors and warehouses can take up to 2 weeks from when we place the order to arrive. Sometimes we'll wait on an order with a specialty vendor in order to hit a order minimum. If it's not coming from our local warehouses with QBP or J&B, ask someone (preferably a buyer) when it should arrive. This is quite important for arraigning service appointments and making sure the customer has a realistic expectation of when their order will arrive. It's much better to be conservative and have it arrive early (in the customer's eyes) than to give an optimistic timeline and disappoint someone.

If you're taking a special order on the day that we're ordering, check with the person working on ordering to see if it'll go on that day's order. Make sure you let them know once the order is fully entered in LS as well - they may have already entered special orders into the shopping carts and sometimes last-minute special orders get missed.  

### How to take a special order from the register window

A [customer must be attached to the sale](\attach) to place a special order. 

Labor, miscellaneous items, and some items with 'non-inventory' tags cannot be special ordered.

Search for the item that you want to special order. It may need to be [imported from a vendor's catalog or created from scratch](\itemcards).

You can expand the item by clicking on it. In the 'Move to' dropdown, select Special Order, and then hit save.

Alternatively if everything in the sale window is being special ordered, you can hit the 'Special Order All' button in the lower left of the screen.

If you need to take a deposit for this special order, instructions can be found [here](\deposit).

You can finish the sale by going through the normal process or simply leave the sale window by clicking any category on the left-side dropdown menu.

***If you hit 'Cancel Sale' at this point, it will remove the item from Special Orders.***

### How to take a special order for a Work Order

That's it!

### How to check out a Special Order

Find the customer's special order by clicking the Inventory category on the left-side dropdown menu. 

After that, find the "Special Orders" button in the middle of the screen in the second row. Type in the customer's name to find their special order in the bar at the top left.

Once you've collected the special ordered product, scan the associated barcode on the slip that will be affixed to the product. 

From there, you'll have to click the "Complete" button that is next to the correct product. Note that you must only complete items marked as "Ready for Pickup"!

After that, the process is identical to closing a regular sale.

Since all special orders require a full deposit in advance, the payment will be taken from the customer's account balance.
