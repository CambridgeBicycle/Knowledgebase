# Receiving and Purchase Orders

### Creating a Purchase Order
Click Inventory on the main Lightspeed menu. You can create a new purchase order by hitting 'New Order' or 'Purchase Orders' and then '+New Purchase Order' in the upper right.

Select the Vendor - vendor names don't always line up with the company name that you're expecting, either check other purchase orders or ask someone if you're not certain which vendor to select. 

Vendor is the only field that's necessary to select. If the purchase order is for Special Orders only, we'll often leave a note to that effect in the General Notes field. If you're creating the PO after the order has been placed, please change the Ordered Date to the day that the order was placed.
