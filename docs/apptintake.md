**Search by customer name or date range up in the uppermost row**

You can narrow down the dates shown and search for the customer's name at the top of the screen. If you're having difficulty finding it, you can try alternative spellings (i.e. Marc vs Mark), search by phone number (just enter the phone number instead of name in the 'Customer' field), or partial words instead of a complete name. 

Once you find the workorder, open it by clicking on the pencil icon on the left.

Confirm the important details: The 'Due' date is the day that the appointment is set for. Make sure that if parts have been special ordered that they've all arrived. Scan both note fields and see if there's anything pertinent. 

Make sure the customer takes their accessories with them! Helmets, full water bottles, locks that are hanging on the frame, things what will interfere with a repair or potentially get lost are the most important.

Let the customer know that they're all set and that they'll get a call or text when the bike is done. That's usually in the late afternoon on the day the repair is scheduled for.

Change the Status field to Open if the repair is ready to proceed on the due date. If it's still waiting for parts to be received, change the status to Waiting for Parts.

Grab a spare pink bike tag. Write down the workorder number on the tag. Add the tag number to the 'Hook In' field.

If the repair is scheduled for today, hit 'Print Tag' to print a copy of the workorder, put that on the 'Due Today' clipboard and let the Service Writer know that an appointment for today has arrived.
