# Opening/Closing procedures
### Opening register
To open the register in the morning, go to the Sales screen and hit open register. Open Register 1. It will prompt you to enter the cash total in the register. There *should* be a receipt left over from the previous day's count-out in the printer. If so, enter the amount in the 'Cash' row and 'Counted' column. 

If the receipt is missing, you can get that information from a 'Register - Closing Counts' report. Make sure that you select the correct register and date!

Register 2 is opened with a count of $0, as we only use it for credit/debit transactions. 

After the registers are open, we want to lock them to their computers (Lightspeed will frequently jump between the registers if they aren't locked, which really complicates the closing procedure). Go to Sales, hit 'Switch Register'. Underneath each Register is an checkbox that says 'Lock', you want to mark Register 1 as locked while using the front cash-wrap computer and lock Register 2 to the Service computer.


### Counting out the register

You should have access to a Google spreadsheet for the month's daily register closeouts. Enter today's date, the day of the week, your name, and a very brief description of the weather. The 'Square' column is a bit misleading - it represents all payments not reflected in Lightspeed. When we have to ring someone up through Square (When Lightspeed goes down or at off-site events) we try to ring those sales through as checks later the same day. So unless it's a very rare situation, the 'Square' column should almost always be $0. 

Go to 'Sales', and hit 'Close Register.' It will start the count-out process for the register that you are currently attached to - pay attention, as it can get switched fairly easily. 

Get the amount from the 'Totals' row and 'Payments' column and enter it onto the Closeout spreadsheet under the appropriate column. If you copy and paste, you may need to remove the formatting(by copy and pasting it into another field) or it can break the macros in the spreadsheet.

Enter the total # of each bill and coin from the cash register into the corresponding fields on the far right of the screen. Enter the total *amount* of cash in the petty cash/change box in the 'Extra' field. The total will hopefully match the 'Total Remaining'  column in the cash row. 

If the counts' don't match (within reason, like more than a few cents), you'll need to figure out where the discrepancy is. The usual issues are a payout (such as a bank run) that hasn't been entered in Lightspeed, cash transactions being accidentally rung up on Register 2, or miss-counting the drawer.

If you can't rectify it yourself, ask for help if another keyholder is around. Otherwise, note it in the 'Notes' field of the closeout doc.

Don't forget to close both registers!
