#How to use text messaging in Lightspeed(Ikeono)
### Logging in
Ikeono is a Chrome plugin that works with Lightspeed. It will occasionally get logged out, you can log back in by clicking 'Show Messages' on the main Lightspeed menu. That password should autofill, or it can be found in the distributor masterlist.
### Best practices 
We try to use texting to replace *routine* phone calls. Notifying a customer that a special order is ready, that a repair is finished, or a reminder that their appointment is tomorrow. There are preset templates you can access by clicking on 'Templates' underneath the message field, they should cover most of your bases. Ikeono should not be used for complicated discussions like going over the specifics of a repair, giving a customer an estimate, or having discussions about our products. These conversations are best had over the phone or in person if possible.

### Starting a new conversation
You can go to the customer's profile page or to a work order for that customer. Hitting the bright blue 'Show Chat' button will open a small panel on the right side of the screen.
### Recent conversations
Hitting 'Show Messages' on the main Lightspeed menu will bring up all recent conversations. You can scroll or search (located at top of the screen) to find what you're looking for. 
### Unread messages
Unread messages will be bolded and marked with a small circle next to them. If you need to make a message as Unread so that others will be more likely to see it, hit the 'Actions' dropdown menu in the top right of the screen.
### Texting receipts and quotes
From a workorder, you can hit 'Text Quote' to automatically send a copy of a workorder to a customer's cell phone. The quote includes all the line items and costs on a work order, but not the internal or external notes fields. 
When you hit 'finish' on a sale, it will open a new window, hit 'Text receipt', and you'll get redirected to the text/email receipt screen. If a customer is already attached to the sale Lightspeed should autofill their phone number, otherwise you can enter it yourself, don't forget to hit 'Send'!
