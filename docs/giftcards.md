# Gift Cards
### Gift Cards VS Deposits/Account Balances
Lightspeed allows us to create store credits as an amount tied to a barcode or to a customer's account. Generally, we mostly use Deposits or credits to account balances for things like a return without a receipt and Gift Cards just for their traditional use. A Gift Card *can* be created attached to a randomly generated number, but shouldn't be.
### Selling a gift card
After starting a sale, there is a Gift Card button near the top left, under the customer field. It will open a new screen.

Grab a gift card, stored to the left of the register.You'll want to scan or manually enter the barcode on the back of it into the field, and enter the dollar amount that the customer wants to add to it. You can do this to both sell a new gift card or to add additional money to a gift card.

After that, you can finish the sale as usual.

### Checking out with a gift card
Go through the checkout process as usual, when you get to the Payment screen, the top right option (right next to Credit/Debit) will be Gift Card. It will prompt you to scan or type out the barcode and then show you the balance on the gift card. In the 'Charge' field, you'll want to enter the amount on the Gift Card that you want applied to the current sale.
### Checking a gift card balance
If you're going through the checkout process, you'll see the gift card balance on the payment screen after you scan the card. You can check a balance without going through a sale as well.
Click on 'Customers' in the main Lightspeed menu, and then Gift Cards. You can scan or type out the barcode here in order to check the balance.
