Appt Intake: Took me a second to realize this is about receiving an existing appt. Might be something with the title or formatting it as a list to make this more obvious? I think the images could be improved if the area in question was highlighted (I can help with the graphic design element if needed). Maybe redundant but reminding people to ask or try alternative spellings or partial words in the search function is helpful. Maybe include a suggestion to briefly review the ticket and due date to make sure expectations are set well.

Gift cards: make sure I’m right about this but I think if you scan the barcode when generating a gift card it will press enter and move on to the sale without giving you the option to set the amount. Your instructions should indicate to select the gift card amount first, just to be safe.

Checking out: this article should be higher up on the list, maybe among the 1st articles? Mention how to adjust quantity and about discount rules? Talk about how to split payment types.

Deposits: doesn’t explicitly say anything about taking deposits for regular old sales items.

Purchase Orders: after the line- “check the items agains the packing slip…” might be helpful to mention: the packing slip is only good enough to verify what the vendor thinks they shipped us, but that should also be checked against the PO in case there is a discrepancy between what we recorded in the PO and what the Vendor invoiced us for. When you say “check that the cost of the item in Lightspeed matches…” any instructions on what to do if they don’t match?

Online orders: this should be more descriptive or explicit that it refers to online BIKE orders.
