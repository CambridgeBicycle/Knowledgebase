"How to intake a service appointment when it comes into the shop"

"Get the customer's name" (or phone number)

"You can narrow down the dates shown and search for the customer's name at the top of the screen." (this would be good to put as "pro tip or something like that"

"If the repair is scheduled for today, hit 'Print Tag' to print a copy of the workorder and let the Service Writer know that an appointment for today has arrived." (put on due today clipboard")

Special Orders

(links are 404)

"Leave the sale window by clicking any category on the left-side dropdown menu." (is this the pinned tools? (I often do finish sale to get out of special order and have it saved, is that okay)) 

"Customer Profiles"
