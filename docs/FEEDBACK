"How to intake a service appointment when it comes into the shop"

"Get the customer's name" (or phone number)

"You can narrow down the dates shown and search for the customer's name at the top of the screen." (this would be good to put as "pro tip or something like that"

"If the repair is scheduled for today, hit 'Print Tag' to print a copy of the workorder and let the Service Writer know that an appointment for today has arrived." (put on due today clipboard")

Special Orders

(links are 404)

"Leave the sale window by clicking any category on the left-side dropdown menu." (is this the pinned tools? (I often do finish sale to get out of special order and have it saved, is that okay)) 

"Customer Profiles"

We want to check that we don't already have a profile for this customer before starting a new one. Lots of customers have multiple profiles that get created for them. Best practice is to search for their first name, and confirm that it's the same person by checking their phone number

(account merging?)

Appt Intake: Took me a second to realize this is about receiving an existing appt. Might be something with the title or formatting it as a list to make this more obvious? I think the images could be improved if the area in question was highlighted (I can help with the graphic design element if needed). Maybe redundant but reminding people to ask or try alternative spellings or partial words in the search function is helpful. Maybe include a suggestion to briefly review the ticket and due date to make sure expectations are set well.

Special Orders: Maybe worth making note of how the notes field on a special order Can be used to communicate with the buying team. Maybe worth presenting an alternative route to find special-orders: you can find a customer’s special order by attaching them to a new sale, all of their special-orders will populate in a separate tab and can be added individually. Easy way to view multiple items and vendors for one customer.

Customer Profiles: first image could benefit from some markup.

Gift cards: make sure I’m right about this but I think if you scan the barcode when generating a gift card it will press enter and move on to the sale without giving you the option to set the amount. Your instructions should indicate to select the gift card amount first, just to be safe.

Checking out: this article should be higher up on the list, maybe among the 1st articles? Mention how to adjust quantity and about discount rules? Talk about how to split payment types.

Deposits: doesn’t explicitly say anything about taking deposits for regular old sales items.

Purchase Orders: after the line- “check the items agains the packing slip…” might be helpful to mention: the packing slip is only good enough to verify what the vendor thinks they shipped us, but that should also be checked against the PO in case there is a discrepancy between what we recorded in the PO and what the Vendor invoiced us for. When you say “check that the cost of the item in Lightspeed matches…” any instructions on what to do if they don’t match?

Online orders: this should be more descriptive or explicit that it refers to online BIKE orders.
