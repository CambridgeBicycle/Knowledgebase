                <h1 id="special-orders">Special Orders</h1>
<h3 id="what-to-check-before-placing-a-special-order">What to check before placing a special order</h3>
<p>First we need to check that an item is in stock. Go to the vendors business-to-business(b2b) site (Don't use their retail consumer site to check inventory!) and make sure that it's available to order. If you're not sure what their B2B is, you can find it in the google doc called 'Distributor Masterlist', which should also be linked as a bookmark on all of our browsers.</p>
<p>In the off-season, it's good practice to make sure that we're able to place orders with vendors - check with one of the buyers to see if there are any issues with that particular vendor. </p>
<p>J&amp;B has very particular rules for their shipping policies - if an item is coming from a warehouse besides New York, check with a buyer before proceeding with the order.  </p>
<p>We take deposits for all special orders. The only exceptions are parts and accessories that we <em>always</em> try to keep in stock. We occasionally make exceptions for repair parts when the customer is leaving their bike with us, provided the cost of the parts is relatively small compared to the value of the bike. This scenario (and only this one) is a judgement call, ask for help if you're not 100% sure.  </p>
<p><strong>We take deposits on all special order bikes, no exceptions.</strong> </p>
<p>The deposit is at least 50% of the sell price. It's not an issue if they'd like to pay in full. We always enter the payment as a deposit in Lightspeed and finish out the sale when the item leaves the store.</p>
<p>There's a notes field for special orders (you can click on the item to expand it and see the notes), this is the best place to pass a message along to the buyers.  </p>
<h3 id="etas-and-timing">ETAs and timing</h3>
<p>We place our orders on Monday mornings. Most of our shipments from east coast and midwestern warehouse will arrive by Thursday. QBP's west coast and J&amp;B's Florida warehouses are probably the second most common warehouses - they take over a week, minimum. Some vendors and warehouses can take up to 2 weeks from when we place the order to arrive. </p>
<p>In addition - sometimes we'll have to wait on an order with a specialty vendor in order to hit a order minimum. If it's not coming from our local warehouses with QBP or J&amp;B, ask someone (preferably a buyer) when it should arrive. This is quite important for arraigning service appointments and making sure the customer has a realistic expectation of when their order will arrive. It's much better to be conservative and have it arrive early (in the customer's eyes) than to give an optimistic timeline and disappoint someone.</p>
<p>Don't forget about holidays! Our vendors and shipping providers are closed for pretty much every minor holiday, which will usually delay orders by 2-ish days. During the winter holiday season, all bets are off for the most part. </p>
<p>If you're taking a special order on the day that we're ordering, check with the person working on ordering to see if it'll go on that day's order. Make sure you let them know once the order is fully entered in LS as well - they may have already entered special orders into the shopping carts and sometimes last-minute special orders get missed.  </p>
<h3 id="how-to-take-a-special-order-from-the-register-window">How to take a special order from the register window</h3>
<p>A <a href="\Knowledgebase\attach">customer must be attached to the sale</a> to place a special order. If we're planning to install the part when it arrives, it should be written up on a work order instead of a sale.</p>
<p>Labor, miscellaneous items, and some items with 'non-inventory' tags cannot be special ordered.</p>
<p>Search for the item that you want to special order. It may need to be <a href="\Knowledgebase\itemcards">imported from a vendor's catalog or created from scratch</a>.   </p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="../images/specord1.png" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="image" src="../images/specord1.png" /></a></p>
<p>You can expand the item by clicking on it. In the 'Move to' dropdown, select Special Order, and then hit save.</p>
<p>Alternatively if everything in the sale window is being special ordered, you can hit the 'Special Order All' button in the lower left of the screen.</p>
<p>If you need to take a deposit for this special order, instructions can be found <a href="\Knowledgebase\deposit">here</a>.</p>
<p>You can finish the sale by going through the normal checkout process or simply leave the sale window by clicking any category on the left-side dropdown menu.</p>
<p><strong><em>If you hit 'Cancel Sale' at this point, it will remove the item from Special Orders.</em></strong></p>
<h3 id="how-to-take-a-special-order-for-a-work-order">How to take a special order for a Work Order</h3>
<p>A special order should be placed on a work order if we're going to be doing the installation or some sort of labor alongside the special order. If the bike isn't scheduled already, try to schedule a date in advance for the work to be done - workorders with loose ideas of when the work will be done or notes like 'setup appointment when parts arrive' are very problematic for the service department, especially in the busy season.</p>
<p>Labor, miscellaneous items, and some items with 'non-inventory' tags cannot be special ordered.</p>
<p>Search for the item that you want to special order. It may need to be <a href="\Knowledgebase\itemcards">imported from a vendor's catalog or created from scratch</a>. You'll want to double check the price in Lightspeed - it should either match MSRP or our pricing conventions. Ask one of the buyers if you're not sure on the pricing.   </p>
<p>Once the item is on the work order, click on it to expand its sub menu. Click the 'Special Order' button to check it, and then click save.</p>

<p>That's it!</p>
<h3 id="how-to-check-out-a-special-order">How to check out a Special Order</h3>
<p>Find the customer's special order by clicking the Inventory category on the left-side dropdown menu. </p>
<p>After that, find the "Special Orders" button in the middle of the screen in the second row. Type in the customer's name to find their special order in the bar at the top left. </p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="../images/specord3.PNG" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="image" src="../images/specord3.PNG" /></a></p>

<p>Once you've collected the special ordered product, scan the associated barcode on the slip that will be affixed to the product. </p>
<p>From there, you'll have to click the "Complete" button that is next to the correct product. Note that you must only complete items marked as "Ready for Pickup"!</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="../images/specorder5.PNG" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="image" src="../images/specorder5.PNG" /></a></p>
<p>After that, the process is identical to closing a regular sale, with either a full or partial payment from the customer's account balance (Assuming they placed a deposit, which is the standard).</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can start a sale and <a href="\Knowledgebase\attach">attach the customer to it</a>. Click the 'Special Orders' tab that appears at the top. All of their special orders will populate and you can select the ones that are ready to be picked up.</p>
