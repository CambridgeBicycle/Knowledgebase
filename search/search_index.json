Go to the vendors business-to-business(b2b) site (Don't use their retail consumer site to check inventory!) and make sure that it's available to order. If you're not sure what their B2B is, you can find it in the google doc called 'Distributor Masterlist', which should also be linked as a bookmark on all of our browsers. In the off-season, it's good practice to make sure that we're able to place orders with vendors - check with one of the buyers to see if there are any issues with that particular vendor. J&B has very particular rules for their shipping policies - if an item is coming from a warehouse besides New York, check with a buyer before proceeding with the order. We take deposits for all special orders. The only exceptions are parts and accessories that we always try to keep in stock. We occasionally make exceptions for repair parts when the customer is leaving their bike with us, provided the cost of the parts is relatively small compared to the value of the bike. This scenario (and only this one) is a judgement call, ask for help if you're not 100% sure. We take deposits on all special order bikes, no exceptions. The deposit is at least 50% of the sell price. It's not an issue if they'd like to pay in full. We always enter the payment as a deposit in Lightspeed and finish out the sale when the item leaves the store. There's a notes field for special orders (you can click on the item to expand it and see the notes), this is the best place to pass a message along to the buyers. ETAs and timing We place our orders on Monday mornings. Most of our shipments from east coast and midwestern warehouse will arrive by Thursday. QBP's west coast and J&B's Florida warehouses are probably the second most common warehouses - they take over a week, minimum. Some vendors and warehouses can take up to 2 weeks from when we place the order to arrive. In addition - sometimes we'll have to wait on an order with a specialty vendor in order to hit a order minimum. If it's not coming from our local warehouses with QBP or J&B, ask someone (preferably a buyer) when it should arrive. This is quite important for arraigning service appointments and making sure the customer has a realistic expectation of when their order will arrive. It's much better to be conservative and have it arrive early (in the customer's eyes) than to give an optimistic timeline and disappoint someone. Don't forget about holidays! Our vendors and shipping providers are closed for pretty much every minor holiday, which will usually delay orders by 2-ish days. During the winter holiday season, all bets are off for the most part. If you're taking a special order on the day that we're ordering, check with the person working on ordering to see if it'll go on that day's order. Make sure you let them know once the order is fully entered in LS as well - they may have already entered special orders into the shopping carts and sometimes last-minute special orders get missed. How to take a special order from the register window A customer must be attached to the sale to place a special order. If we're planning to install the part when it arrives, it should be written up on a work order instead of a sale. Labor, miscellaneous items, and some items with 'non-inventory' tags cannot be special ordered. Search for the item that you want to special order. It may need to be imported from a vendor's catalog or created from scratch . You can expand the item by clicking on it. In the 'Move to' dropdown, select Special Order, and then hit save. Alternatively if everything in the sale window is being special ordered, you can hit the 'Special Order All' button in the lower left of the screen. If you need to take a deposit for this special order, instructions can be found here . You can finish the sale by going through the normal checkout process or simply leave the sale window by clicking any category on the left-side dropdown menu. If you hit 'Cancel Sale' at this point, it will remove the item from Special Orders. How to take a special order for a Work Order A special order should be placed on a work order if we're going to be doing the installation or some sort of labor alongside the special order. If the bike isn't scheduled already, try to schedule a date in advance for the work to be done - workorders with loose ideas of when the work will be done or notes like 'setup appointment when parts arrive' are very problematic for the service department, especially in the busy season. Labor, miscellaneous items, and some items with 'non-inventory' tags cannot be special ordered. Search for the item that you want to special order. It may need to be imported from a vendor's catalog or created from scratch . You'll want to double check the price in Lightspeed - it should either match MSRP or our pricing conventions. Ask one of the buyers if you're not sure on the pricing. Once the item is on the work order, click on it to expand its sub menu. Click the 'Special Order' button to check it, and then click save. That's it! How to check out a Special Order Find the customer's special order by clicking the Inventory category on the left-side dropdown menu. After that, find the \"Special Orders\" button in the middle of the screen in the second row. Type in the customer's name to find their special order in the bar at the top left. Once you've collected the special ordered product, scan the associated barcode on the slip that will be affixed to the product. From there, you'll have to click the \"Complete\" button that is next to the correct product. Note that you must only complete items marked as \"Ready for Pickup\"! After that, the process is identical to closing a regular sale, with either a full or partial payment from the customer's account balance (Assuming they placed a deposit, which is the standard). Alternatively, you can start a sale and attach the customer to it . Click the 'Special Orders' tab that appears at the top.

We want to attach a customer to every bike sale, with their first and last name and phone number. All of our bikes are serialized items in Lightspeed, so it will prompt you to enter the serial number and won't let you finish the sale without it. The serial number should be both saved in Lightspeed and written down on the price tag for the bike. If not, grab it off the bottom bracket shell. If Lightspeed doesn't prompt you for the serial, it was likely imported or created incorrectly. If possible, open up the item card , change the item type to 'Serialized', and enter the serial number before proceeding. You can select the serial number by clicking on the white search field labeled 'Scan or type a serial number'. If your serial is not on the list or there are no serial numbers entered for that bike (happens occasionally when bikes are received in a rush) you can add the serial yourself. If a bike that's sold isn't leaving the shop within a few hours (usually because we're installing quite a few accessories, the customer isn't ready to take it home, or it needs to be special ordered ), we prefer to not fully close out the sale and instead take the full payment as a deposit on a workorder . This makes it significantly easier to keep track of until it leaves the shop. If the customer is taking the bike immediately, you can finish the sale like any other and hand the bike over to the mechanics for an out-the-door check. Out the door check We always do a final mechanical check on a bike after we sell it before it leaves the shop, this is usually (but not always) when we install the accessories that the customer has picked out. It usually takes a mechanic about 10 minutes in a best case scenario. It's important to check in with the service writer about when they can accommodate the work - by their nature the out-the-door process is last minute. Be sure to mention all the accessories that are being installed - they can add a significant amount of time. If the OTD and installs work won't be done on the same day, it's helpful to create a work order to keep everything straight forward for the mechanics. After creating a new workorder, you can type /OTD in the notes field and textblaze will fill in a template for you. Freebies and discounts If a customer is buying a new bike and at least 5 accessories (anything else in the store besides another bike, essentially), we offer a 10% discount on all those accessories(Just the accessories, not the bike or any labor). For all new bikes we sell, we offer 1 free tune-up within the first year of purchase. We usually recommend that customers come in after 6 months if the bike is being used regularly.","title":"Bike sales"},{"location":"bikesale/#bike-sales","text":"","title":"Bike sales"},{"location":"bikesale/#checkout-procedure","text":"Bike sales have a few quirks that make them different from regular sales. We want to attach a customer to every bike sale, with their first and last name and phone number. All of our bikes are serialized items in Lightspeed, so it will prompt you to enter the serial number and won't let you finish the sale without it. The serial number should be both saved in Lightspeed and written down on the price tag for the bike. If not, grab it off the bottom bracket shell. If Lightspeed doesn't prompt you for the serial, it was likely imported or created incorrectly. If possible, open up the item card , change the item type to 'Serialized', and enter the serial number before proceeding. You can select the serial number by clicking on the white search field labeled 'Scan or type a serial number'. If your serial is not on the list or there are no serial numbers entered for that bike (happens occasionally when bikes are received in a rush) you can add the serial yourself. If a bike that's sold isn't leaving the shop within a few hours (usually because we're installing quite a few accessories, the customer isn't ready to take it home, or it needs to be special ordered ), we prefer to not fully close out the sale and instead take the full payment as a deposit on a workorder . This makes it significantly easier to keep track of until it leaves the shop. If the customer is taking the bike immediately, you can finish the sale like any other and hand the bike over to the mechanics for an out-the-door check.","title":"Checkout procedure"},{"location":"bikesale/#out-the-door-check","text":"We always do a final mechanical check on a bike after we sell it before it leaves the shop, this is usually (but not always) when we install the accessories that the customer has picked out.

If the voucher has been redeemed or cancelled or expired, you will not be able to redeem it. If the customer is using the voucher now, you can hit redeem now. If the customer will be using the voucher but we don't have all the necessary information to redeem it (likely situation would be the serial number of a special order bike), then we can put a hold on the voucher. Redeeming an E-Bike or Bike voucher After hitting 'Redeem now', the next page will have you select our shop, enter your name, confirm that you've checked the customer's ID, enter the bike's make/model/serial number, and the total amount on the receipt. The receipt should only have item(s) on it that are eligible for the voucher you are redeeming! Bikes/Accessories/Non-eligible items/labor should be on separate receipts! You will need to upload a PDF of the receipt showing the full cost of the eligible item(s), voucher payment (this is a payment method in Lightspeed), and any additional customer payment if necessary. Cambridge vouchers CAN be used to pay for sales tax, unlike the other programs. Press \"Submit Invoice\" when all fields are filled out. Placing an Available Voucher on hold If the customer is committing to buying a bike but we don't have the serial number available (e.g. we need to special order the bike), we will place a hold on the voucher so that it's not redeemed else where. After checking the voucher status, hit the 'Hold Voucher' button, select our shop and then hit 'Confirm Voucher hold'. If the amount of the bike is over the voucher amount, you will still collect a deposit for the remaining amount. Releasing and redeeming an On Hold voucher. You may only release or redeem a voucher placed on hold by our store ONLY a manager should be releasing a held voucher. You do not need to release a voucher our store placed on hold before redeeming it Direct any customer requests to the store that originally placed the hold Hit 'Redeem voucher now' and you will go through the standard redemption process and be prompted to enter the serial number and upload the receipt. Releasing a voucher makes it available for use at all other participating bike shops. Redeeming an accessories voucher Very similar to the bike voucher redemption process. You will be prompted to summarize the accessories purchased as well as upload. The voucher may be applied to any accessories that \"make cycling safer and more comfortable.\" This includes child seats or a car bike rack. The voucher may also be used for sales tax on those accessories. It MAY NOT be used for bikes, ebikes, or labor. Accessories that don't match the spirit of the \"safe and comfortable\" guideline are at our discretion, ask for guidance if you're not sure. Redeeming a maintenance voucher Very similar to the process of redeeming other vouchers, but there are a few requirements. * Maintenance vouchers can only be redeemed after the associated bike voucher is redeemed. * Maintenance vouchers can only be redeemed at the store that the associated bike voucher was redeemed at. * Maintenance vouchers can only be redeemed for maintenance costs of the bike purchased with the associated bike voucher. * This is not explicitly stated, but until the City of Cambridge clarifies, we should assume that the maintenance refers to strictly that and NOT optional upgrades (even really cool stuff like fender installs). * Unused portion of the voucher cannot be transferred or used for other purposes.

Open Register 1. It will prompt you to enter the cash total in the register. There should be a receipt left over from the previous day's count-out in the printer. If so, enter the amount in the 'Cash' row and 'Counted' column. If the receipt is missing, you can get that information from a 'Register - Closing Counts' report. Make sure that you select the correct register and date! Register 2 is opened with a count of $0, as we only use it for credit/debit transactions. After the registers are open, we want to lock them to their computers (Lightspeed will frequently jump between the registers if they aren't locked, which really complicates the closing procedure). Go to Sales, hit 'Switch Register'. Underneath each Register is an checkbox that says 'Lock', you want to mark Register 1 as locked while using the front cash-wrap computer and lock Register 2 to the Service computer. Counting out the register You should have access to a Google spreadsheet for the month's daily register closeouts. Enter today's date, the day of the week, your name, and a very brief description of the weather. The 'Square' column is a bit misleading - it represents all payments not reflected in Lightspeed. When we have to ring someone up through Square (When Lightspeed goes down or at off-site events) we try to ring those sales through as checks later the same day. So unless it's a very rare situation, the 'Square' column should almost always be $0. Go to 'Sales', and hit 'Close Register.' It will start the count-out process for the register that you are currently attached to - pay attention, as it can get switched fairly easily. Get the amount from the 'Totals' row and 'Payments' column and enter it onto the Closeout spreadsheet under the appropriate column. If you copy and paste, you may need to remove the formatting(by copy and pasting it into another field) or it can break the macros in the spreadsheet. Enter the total # of each bill and coin from the cash register into the corresponding fields on the far right of the screen. Enter the total amount of cash in the petty cash/change box in the 'Extra' field. The total will hopefully match the 'Total Remaining' column in the cash row. If the counts' don't match (within reason, like more than a few cents), you'll need to figure out where the discrepancy is. The usual issues are a payout (such as a bank run) that hasn't been entered in Lightspeed, cash transactions being accidentally rung up on Register 2, or miss-counting the drawer. If you can't rectify it yourself, ask for help if another keyholder is around. Otherwise, note it in the 'Notes' field of the closeout doc.

Enter today's date, the day of the week, your name, and a very brief description of the weather. The 'Square' column is a bit misleading - it represents all payments not reflected in Lightspeed. When we have to ring someone up through Square (When Lightspeed goes down or at off-site events) we try to ring those sales through as checks later the same day. So unless it's a very rare situation, the 'Square' column should almost always be $0. Go to 'Sales', and hit 'Close Register.' It will start the count-out process for the register that you are currently attached to - pay attention, as it can get switched fairly easily. Get the amount from the 'Totals' row and 'Payments' column and enter it onto the Closeout spreadsheet under the appropriate column. If you copy and paste, you may need to remove the formatting(by copy and pasting it into another field) or it can break the macros in the spreadsheet. Enter the total # of each bill and coin from the cash register into the corresponding fields on the far right of the screen. Enter the total amount of cash in the petty cash/change box in the 'Extra' field. The total will hopefully match the 'Total Remaining' column in the cash row. If the counts' don't match (within reason, like more than a few cents), you'll need to figure out where the discrepancy is. The usual issues are a payout (such as a bank run) that hasn't been entered in Lightspeed, cash transactions being accidentally rung up on Register 2, or miss-counting the drawer. If you can't rectify it yourself, ask for help if another keyholder is around. Otherwise, note it in the 'Notes' field of the closeout doc. Don't forget to close both registers!","title":"Counting out the register"},{"location":"deposit/","text":"Deposits When to take a deposit We generally take full deposits for bikes that are sold but not picked up yet and special order bikes. We usually take half deposits for repair appointments that have special orders that we don't normally stock. (e.g. If a customer needs, say a basic 8 speed chain and we happen to be out of them, we wouldn't usually take a deposit for that). If the bike for that repair is being left at the shop until the repair is completed, you can generally treat that as collateral instead of taking a deposit, provided that the parts aren't worth more than the bike. This is something you absolutely want a second opinion on if you have any questions. How to take a deposit You'll need to be in a sale window with the customer attached to the sale to take a deposit. You do NOT need to have any items added to the sale. Hit payment to go to the payment screen. The top row, marked 'Open Orders', will have the total cost of all the customer's special orders and workorders. Underneath that will be the 'Add Deposit button'. Hitting that will open a pop-up that will prompt you to enter an amount, and that amount will be added to the total payment collected today. Finish the sale as usual. How to checkout a customer with a deposit on file With the customer account attached to the sale, proceed to the payment screen as you normally would. The 'Account' field will have an available total, which is the deposit(s) that they've placed with us. Customers may have placed multiple deposits and we'd like to keep the proper deposit on file if for example they have placed 2 special orders and are only picking up one, so if the amounts don't match up look in their customer profile. Either type in the amount of the deposit you'd like to apply to this sale or hit the 'Max' button to apply the total deposit.

The description should include the brand name, item name, and any descriptors (like size or color if it comes in multiple variations). Only 45 characters will print out on the price tag, so be sure that important things (like a bike's size) aren't in that section. It can be helpful to look at similar items, especially from the same manufacturer, to get an idea of how to name an item. Capitalize appropriately! Importing item cards from a Catalog When you need to import an item from a vendor's catalog, you'll generally be doing it from the search field of a sale, work order, or purchase order. The easiest way to find the exact item you're looking for is to search for the item's UPC, a manufacturer's SKU, or a vendor's item code. You will need to click the 'Advanced' drop-down right next to the search button and make sure that the 'Catalog results' button is checked. The search results will show up in two different tabs. The left tab will show you matching results already in our inventory (if any) and the right tab will be all matching results from all our vendor catalogs. You want to make sure that you're selecting the right item, from the right vendor. The vendor you select should usually be the name of the vendor we order from. It gets confusing, as some companies have obsolete catalogs available through Lightspeed or the product is carried by many distributors. For example, searches for a Cane Creek headset product will return 10 results, all for the same product. Usually the correct answer for what catalog to pick is QBP, J&B, or the manufacturer's name. Once you know which item to import, hit the 'Import' button on the far left of that row. It should open up the item card for the new item. Most of the fields should auto-fill, but you'll need to set the Category nearly every time. Verify that the cost (from our distributor) is accurate, as well as the 'Default Price' and the name (Make it readable and match as close as possible to other) Creating item cards from scratch You'll very rarely create item cards from scratch, but occasionally it'll be necessary if an item isn't in any vendor catalogs and there isn't a similar item to duplicate. Go to 'Inventory' from the main Lightspeed menu, and click on 'New Item'. A blank item card will be created. At a minimum, we want to have a description, UPC if there is a barcode on the item, a category, brand, our cost and the price we'll sell it at. The description should include the brand name, item name, and any descriptors (like size or color if it comes in multiple variations). Only 45 characters will print out on the price tag, so be sure that important things (like a bike's size) aren't in that section. It can be helpful to look at similar items, especially from the same manufacturer, to get an idea of how to name an item. Capitalize appropriately! Creating a box assembly When we order bulk products that we sell in smaller units, we create two items for that. The 'box' item will be the one that shows up in vendor catalogs and our purchase orders. The single item will be the one that gets sold. Import the box item as normal, add '(Do not sell)' to the beginning of the description, and change the type to 'Box'. Make sure that the default price is not set to $0, we prefer something outrageously high so that this item doesn't get rung up on accident and screw up the inventory. We generally remove the UPC and EAN from the box item, so that we can use the barcode on the bulk box to ring up an item. Hit 'Save Changes', and then go to the 'Box' section on the left side of the screen. If the item that we'll be selling singles of has already been created, you can search for it on the right hand side. Otherwise, underneath that it will prompt you to create an item and allow you to edit the description and the number of items per box. Creating a Matrix Goto inventory New Matrix, upper right in green You'll be prompted to enter all the shared values, cost, and price. We want all the fields filled out on this page. The attributes drop down will allow you to select the types of attributes that will differentiate the items in the matrix. After you hit Save changes for the first time, the attributes fields will populate and you can start filling them in. Creating a new item by duplicating If a new item needs to be added that shares most characteristics of another item but isn't available from a vendors' catalog and isn't appropriate for a matrix type item, you can duplicate an item. From an item card, hit the 'Duplicate' button in the top right corner. That will create an item with all of the same characteristics as the original, except it will remove the UPC, SKUs, and Vendor IDs from the new item. The name will also have 'Copy of' added to the old name.","title":"Creating and Importing item cards"},{"location":"itemcards/#item-cards","text":"","title":"Item cards"},{"location":"itemcards/#best-practices","text":"All new bikes that we sell have to have the 'Serialized' button checked on their item card!

You can create a new purchase order by hitting 'New Order' or 'Purchase Orders' and then '+New Purchase Order' in the upper right. Select the Vendor - vendor names don't always line up with the company name that you're expecting, either check other recent purchase orders or ask someone if you're not certain which vendor to select. Vendor is the only field that's absolutely necessary to select. The reference # is usually used for the order number on the packing slip. Ordered date will auto-fill the date that the purchase order was created, change it to the date the order was placed. General notes are where we put the bulk of extra info. The first line of of general notes are visible on the main PO screen, if the PO is only special orders we want to leave a note to that effect first. We'll often split large orders into several purchase orders - for example our regularly weekly orders with QBP and J&B will be quite large, so on the day we place the order we'll create a PO for all the Special Orders for customers and then another order for each shipment when it arrives. In the 'Costs' section, the two dropdown menus need to be set to 'Don't apply to items'. If the Discount field isn't set properly, you won't be able to edit the item costs while receiving. If we paid for the shipping, we like to enter it here as well. Receiving a shipment When a shipment arrives and is ready to be received, first check to see if a purchase order has already been created for it. You'll first want to check the items against the packing slip to make sure that we received everything we ordered. Create a new purchase order if one hasn't been created already. The PO will need to be set to 'Open' or 'Ordered' in order to add items and edit quantities. If creating a new purchase order, you'll add the items to the PO one by one in the 'Add Items' field. You can search by the item name, vendor IDs, or UPCs. We generally use a barcode scanner or the vendor IDs from of the packing slip. As you go through the packing list: check that the cost of the item in Lightspeed matches the packing slip, the quantity received is correct, and that the vendorID field is filled in. Once you've entered all the items in the shipment or if the PO was already created, change the status of the PO to 'Check In'. If you've already checked that the PO exactly matches the cost and quantity of what we received, you can hit 'Receive all items'. Otherwise, go through it line by line and set the correct quantity that we received as well as the actual cost displayed on the packing slip (or the distributors b2b site if there is no packing slip). Once you're done hit 'Add received to inventory', which is the step that updates our inventory. Bikes require that we record the serial number before we enter it into inventory. Nearly all of our manufacturers print the serial number of the bike on its box. A few brands do not, which necessitates pulling the bike out of the bike, recording the serial number, and sealing it back up . If there are special orders on this PO, there are a few more steps below. Otherwise, if everything on the PO has been received and added to inventory, change the state to 'Finished'. If there are still items on the PO that haven't arrived yet, leave it in the 'Check In' state. Receiving special orders There are a few extra steps when you create a PO that include a special order or receive items that are a special order. While creating a PO, you'll want to click on the 'Special Orders' field on the left side of the screen. This will bring up all of the Special Orders (if any) already on this PO at the top, as well as all of the special orders not currently on a purchase order below that. They'll be color coded - Red for not ordered/added to a PO, Orange once it has been added to a PO, or Green when it has been fully received. If the PO includes the same item for stock and for a special order, you can edit the quantity if necessary on the main 'Order' screen of the PO. You'll receive the special order items like any other item in the main order window. Once that's done, click on 'Special Orders' on the left side of the screen. The special order will get a paper printout attached to it. If it's a item that a customer will simply come and pick up, you can click on the print icon. You can click the speech bubble icon to automatically send a text to the customer that their special order is ready. Alternatively, call them(if you need to do more than just notify them, like ask a question or something) or send an email (if we have that but not a phone number). If a customer has ordered more than one item and they'll be arriving around the same time, we generally wait until everything has arrived before notifying them. Once you've reached out, click on the checkbox next to 'Called' to mark that they've been contacted. If the item is for a repair, there should be a work order number, click on that link and print out a copy of the work order. For items that are attached to work orders, you'll need to check to see if any further steps are necessary. If all of the parts are now in the shop, the workorder status should be set to 'Open' or 'Appointment' as appropriate. Occasionally the customer will need to be notified that the parts have arrived so that they can setup an appointment to get them install - this is best handled by the service writer for the day, hand it off to them unless you feel confident in your ability to do that. If the repair is scheduled for today or a prior day, give the service writer a paper copy of the workorder and let them know that the parts are here and the repair needs to be scheduled. Once the special order is tagged, it needs to be put away. Special orders for repairs go in the yellow bins on the bakers racks downstairs, organized by the date that the repair is scheduled for (there's an overflow bin for repairs with uncertain dates). Other special orders go in the clear bins just past the receiving desk, organized by the customer's first name. Try to group special orders for the same person together so that they're easier to find. If a repair has lots of special order parts that will potentially overfill the yellow bins, grab a cardboard box to use instead and staple a copy of the workorder or special order slips to it.","title":"Receiving and Purchase Orders"},{"location":"receiving/#receiving-and-purchase-orders","text":"","title":"Receiving and Purchase Orders"},{"location":"receiving/#general-notes","text":"Click Inventory on the main Lightspeed menu.

New items may also be returned for store credit within one month. No returns on used parts. How to process a return Returns are always handled by a keyholder or manager - most employees' Lightspeed accounts won't allow them to process returns. With a receipt in hand, the easiest way to handle a return is to start a new sale and then scan the barcode at the bottom of the receipt It should automatically bring up the return tab and customer's account (if one exists and is attached to the sale). Click the 'Refund' button next to the item(s) that are being returned. If the customer is purchasing anything else, click on the 'Sale' tab to add other items to the transaction. Proceed to the payment screen. If the customer has money going back to them, select the original payment type. For credit cards, hit \"Credit/Debit\" on the payment field and then there should be a button that displays the type of card and last few digits. If that's not there, you may need to have the customer re-insert the credit/debit card into the reader. Returns after 7 days should be returned to a customer's account as a store credit. Finish the sale and let the customer know that they should receive a refund as soon as their bank/CC company processes it. Finding a receipt If a customer didn't take or lost their receipt, there are a handful of different ways to track it down. If they have a customer account that's already created, pull that up by clicking on 'Customers' on the main menu, and then searching for their name or phone number. Once in their account page, click on 'Sales' in the submenu. If you can find the item you're looking for, click on the corresponding link in the ID column, and then the 'Refund' button at the top of the following page. If the 'Refund' button doesn't appear on the transaction page, you're usually not logged into a Lightspeed profile that has permissions to process returns. If the customer doesn't have a receipt and the sale wasn't attached to their profile, the best way to track down receipts is usually in the 'Reports' section. You'll need to get some additional information from the customer - Date of purchase and the total amount of the transaction are the most helpful, and the easiest to find if the customer paid with a credit card. If they didn't pay with a card, it can occasionally be helpful to know if they purchased anything else at the same time. With the total amount and the date, the 'Payments received' report will be easy to track down a transaction by the amount spent. I usually search for the day they think they made the purchase on as well as a few days beforehand (Credit card statements aren't always accurate on the dates). Click on the ID #, and then 'Credit Card' on the left submenu - you can verify the last four digits of their credit card there.

The following are some notes about the more important and less obvious statuses. Setting this accurately is very important, repairs set to the wrong status are one of the biggest headaches that the service department deals with. Open - This is the status that a work order will be set to by default. This denotes that the repair has been approved, that the bike is here, and that there's no reason not to proceed with the repair. Estimate - An un-approved estimate for service. Assigned - This is scheduled to be worked on today, and it has been assigned to a mechanic. Waiting for Customer - We're waiting for the customer to respond before the repair can proceed. This is usually used when we discover additional issues while working on a repair and we're waiting for a callback with approval. Waiting for parts - This repair is approved and ready to be started on, the only thing preventing us from proceeding are special order parts that haven't arrived. Needs QC Repair is finished, but needs to go through the quality control check. Sales leads If a salesperson needs to collect a good deal of notes to help out a customer and wants to store it as a workorder so that they can follow up later. These will generally be ignored by everyone else, don't expect anyone else to look at it or follow up on it automatically. Date In/ Due Date Date in will auto-fill to the date and time that the work-order is created. We want to leave that as it is - we use this field to track when a bike entered the shop to be evaluated. Due date is when the bike is due. We don't use the time field - repairs are due by the end of the day generally, if it needs to be finished by a specific time it should be marked in the notes. Hook In/Out Hook in is where we track the hook downstairs that is occupied by the bike, matching the pink hang tag on the bike. We also sometimes enter 'Kickstand' to denote a bike that we took downstairs or tucked in a corner that's too heavy for a hook, 'Wheel Hooks' for the wheel storage above the back desk, and 'Sales Hooks' for the rows of shop bikes next to the repair bikes. Hook out is where the service department tracks the amount of labor on the ticket. This is usually a $ and the amount of labor (not including the discounts and rounded to an easy to read number) on the ticket. This is how the service department tracks how much service they have scheduled on a particular day. We also track this number on the calendar by the main service computer, so if you're adding service to the next available appt date, please add it there as well. Receipt note/internal note Receipt notes are visible to the customer. We use a browser extension called Text-Blaze that will auto-fill some prompts in the note field, you can right click in the note field and navigate to 'Text Blaze' or use keyboard shortcuts (/wo is the standard one for workorders). Bear in mind, Receipt notes are visible to the customer! Internal notes will not print out on a paper copy either, so notes meant to be read by the mechanic doing the work should be entered in the receipt notes field (Best practice would be to also leave a comment on the corresponding line item as well). Internal notes are where we keep the bulk of information related to a repair, generally so that it doesn't clutter up the customer's receipt with a bunch of procedural chatter. When updating a ticket's internal notes, we want to see the newest updates writted at the top with each update accompanied by your initials and the date. Line items You can enter the line items that will appear on the customer's receipt here. It's generally a good idea to include all services that will be performed - receipt/internal notes can often get overlooked by the mechanic. The buttons can be used as a shortcut to find the more common line items. Hitting them will either open a sub-menu with more buttons or add a specific line item to the work order. Of note - the 'Misc Item'(generally only used for used or take-off parts) and 'Misc Labor' should be avoided and used only as a last resort.
